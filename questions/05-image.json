            "text": "Web APIs Queue",
            "correct": false
        }
    ],
    "explanation": "The **Microtask Queue** has higher priority. After every macrotask (from the Callback Queue) is executed, the Event Loop checks the Microtask Queue and executes *all* tasks in it before moving to the next macrotask."
